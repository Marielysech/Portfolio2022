I have a thirst for knowledge and thrive when needing to adapt to new challenges. 👩‍💻 Becoming a Full Stack developer is a way to quench my curiosity as it requires me to learn and adapt to fast-moving technologies constantly. It allows me to use both critical thinking and creativity to express myself. 🔎  Passionate about understanding users, I capitalize on 4+ years as a market researcher to develop user-centric app with UX as a priority. 🤝  Collaboration and teamwork are crucial to me to expand my points of view and acquire new skills. I'm looking forward to joining a team to benefit from their experiences and knowledge as well as to bring my contribution to reach together common objectives. 📣  I'm open to a remote position within EU or on-site in Madrid. If you think my profile could be a good match for your team, write me to discuss it over a (virtual) coffee",
